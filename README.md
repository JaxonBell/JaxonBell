- ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
Githubl(https://github.com/catherineisonline/scandi/blob/main/Github20profile.png?raw-true)
With 9 years of diverse experience in sales, customer support, social media, and tean management, I am a highly adaptable and versatile
professional looking to transition into the field of front-end web development. As a junior developer, I may not have extensive experience yet, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in passion and drive to learn. I am deeply passionate about creating
responsive and beautiful websites using modern JavaScript, and I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.
I am a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that my unique blend of skills and experience will make me an asset to any
development team. I am eager to take on new challenges and ontribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. I am looking for an opportunity to join a company where I can grow and learn as a front-end developer and where I can put my skills to use in real-world.
